## Ingredients

- ingredients you should buy
    - 400ml coconut milk
    - 400g codfish 
    - 400g of green beans
    - 2 teaspoons of ginger
    - coriander leaves
    
- ingredients you should already have
    - 2 to 3 cups of rice
    - 1 onion
    - 3 cloves of garlic
    - 3 teaspoons of curry (madras) powder
    - 2 teaspoons of turmeric/curcuma
    - salt
    - pepper
    - lemon juice

## Instructions

- Preparation
    - If you are using frozen codfish, take it out of the freezer a few hours before cooking. If you are a bit absent-minded like me and forgot this step when you start cooking; no worries. Cut the frozen codfish into pieces with all your power and just let the mix simmer for a bit longer to give the codfish the time to thaw.
- Cooking
    - Cut the onion and fry it with oil in a stir-fry pan.
    - Cook the rice in a pan and the green beans in another. Once they are finished, set them aside.
    - Cut the gember and garlic, and then add that to the pan together with the turmeric/curcuma and the curry powder. Let it simmer for a few minutes.
    - Add the coconut milk to the mix and a few minutes later cut the codfish into pieces and add that too.
    - Let the entire mix simmer for about ten minutes.
    - Add salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste. Serve in platters, add the beans on top and serve the rice on the side.
